# #30DayMapChallenge - Day 1 - Points

# About
MunroMap is a simple OpenLayers map created as part of the 2021 [#30DayMapChallenge](https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge) for day 1 "Points".

Displayed are all 282 [Munros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munro), which are mountains in Scotland over 3000ft tall.

Munro information is gathered from the [Munro API](https://munroapi.herokuapp.com).

# The techy bit

- To run use `npm start`
- To build, please use `npm run build`
- This is a basic OpenLayers map forked from my [openlayers-typescript-template](https://github.com/DafyddLlyr/openlayers-typescript-template) repo
- The purpose of this was to try out the OS Data Hub, and to use a bit of vanilla JavaScript which I don't do much!
